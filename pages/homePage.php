                <h4>Our Mission</h4>
                <div class="contentHide">
                    <p>Nassau County is objectively one of the most corrupt counties in the nation. Due in no small part to the amount of revenue it generates through taxation (see, theft), it only stands to reason that the most corrupt and parasitic of persons would be allowed to be charged with its rule.</p> <p>There is, unfortunately, albeit realistically and understandably, an acceptable level of corruption and betrayal that will occur within a governmental body. No one is perfect, and elections do not occur perfectly, to be generous. However, the levels of criminality displayed by the elected or otherwise appointed officials of Nassaau County, NY are beyond any acceptable level of corruption.</p><p> One could argue they toe the line with treason and treachery, but for the sake of not being melodramatic one could simply say its "ruling elite" do not have the best interest of any of its people in mind. In any other period of time or place, it might not be unreasonable to assume that such a governmental body would have been dissolved by the sheer will of the people and replaced by one which truly has their best interests in mind.</p> 
                    <p>The will of people is often commonly neglected as a tool for change. Oftentimes one may think that their voice has no power, that they are unfairly represented, yet unable to have any significant impact as an individual. While this may oftentimes be true of one single individual, what is not often discussed, in a time of such division, is how the unification of the people who are being ruled may be able to pose a true threat to the rulers.</p><p>It is time to set aside any differences that society has engrained into the populace, and for fellow brothers and sisters that share the same underclass to recognize that they are not being targeted for any reason that the media would have them believe, but because we are not "them", and as such, viewed as beneath them. A peaceful resistance is the most powerful of movements. No person truly wishes to break the law or upset the relatively smooth running society that allows for all the comforts we have come to appreciate. The system cannot be defeated by playing by the rules of said system, no more than a casino can be defeated by attempting to test luck. It is only by saying "no", and refusing to partake in their game, can one truly flip the table.</p><p>The time for petty differences must be set aside, and even more so for greater differences, for if one were to triumph over the corrupt overlords that see us as nothing more than a currency, they would need the support of all their fellow citizens. It is by this such method that results can be achieved.</p> 
                        <p>The problems we face are local, and they must be dealt with locally. The divisions forced upon us by political party, race, creed, religion, culture, etc are only beneficial to those who seek to exploit us. If the people were to agree, at the very least, on one thing, that they are unhappy with how their government treats them, then all other issues could subsequently be resolved. This is said only to emphasize that any personal gripes one person may have can never be corrected until those who rule us are replaced by those who love us.</p> <p>Love is everything, as a family operates based on love of their kin, so should a government operate on the love of its people. If the government is not loved, but continues to dictate what our fate is, what right do they have to rule us? Their power is guaranteed only by the legitimacy that we grant it.</p><p>Perhaps it is time that the people ask for something better, stand up for themselves, put their differences aside, and acknowledge that any conflict amongst ourselves only benefits "them". A united people is a body that can dictate change. It can force results.</p>  
                            <p>The journey is not an easy one to accept, and surely much background knowledge must be shared to help us understand how this came to be, but to free ourselves from tyranny, it is necessary to understand that our refusal to partake in it is the greatest strength we have. End the divisions they employ that seek to weaken us, for the people do ultimately have the power, and no other issue matters more until we reclaim that power.          </p> 
                    <p>The Truthers will triumph.</p>
